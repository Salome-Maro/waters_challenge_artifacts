# Analysis Results for the MobSTr dataset

This folder contains a number of analysis results, mostly derived from the Amalthea model in the `org.panorama-research.mobstr.amalthea` folder. They include the following:

* `dse_analysis/results.json`: Timing Analysis results in machine-readable format (JSON)
* `dse_analysis/_dse_interpreter/_chart_visualizer/charts.html`: Visualisation of the timing analysis results (HTML)
* `model_analysis/_chart_visualizer/charts.html`: Visualisation of label accesses (HTML)

Details about these analyses can be found in the following papers:
