# MobSTr Dataset Artifact Model

This project contains an artifact model of the MobSTr Dataset. This means that it shows the different artifacts that are available and how they are related with each other. The model is the source for the traceability information model in `org.panorama-research.mobstr.tim`.

Not all artifacts mentioned in the model are actually included in this Github repository. All artifacts marked in *red* are not currently available. Artifacts in *orange* are available, but not included in this repository.

Pleae also note that some of the classes contain comments that describe their purpose. The easiest way to see these comments is to open Papyrus' "Documentation" view and click on the respective class.
