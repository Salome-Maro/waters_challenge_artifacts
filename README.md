# WATERS FMTV 2019 Challenge Artefacts provided by the PANORAMA Project

This repository contains artifacts such as requirements and architecture models for the [WATERS FMTV 2019 challenge][1]. The WATERS FMTV 2019 challenge is an industrial case study used as part of the 10th International Workshop on Analysis Tools and Methodologies for Embedded and Real-time Systems (WATERS). It was originally proposed by Arne Hamann, Dakshina Dasari, and Falk Wurst, Corporate Research Robert Bosch GmbH and Ignacio SaÃ±udo, Nicola Capodieci, Paolo Burgio and Marko Bertogna, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. 

The artifacts in this repository are based on the solution to the challenge provided by the [PANORAMA research project][2] in the [APP4MC Eclipse project][3]. The corresponding AMALTHEA model for the challenge is included here. The original file can be found in the [APP4MC Github Repository][4].

Requirements and architectural information have been derived directly from the challenge description. All other artifacts are based on this. We make no claim on the completeness or correctness of any of the artefacts available for download here.

Additionally the repository contains a custom traceability information model (TIM) that defines which link types can be created between the different artifacts. The current TIM is based on the artifact model in project `org.panorama.research.waters-2019.traceMetamodel`. It is implemented for use in  [Eclipse Capra](https://eclipse.org/capra).  The TIM project is located in `org.panorama.research.waters-2019.traceMetamodel`.

## How to use the custom TIM
The current TIM is not packaged yet with an Eclipse Capra distribution and therefore can only be used in the development environment. Use the following instructions to try out the TIM.  

* Download Eclipse Capra developement environment using instructions provided [here](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Capra#Using_the_Eclipse_Installer)
* Close the project `org.eclipse.capra.generic.tracemodel`
* Import the project `org.panorama.research.waters-2019.traceMetamodel` into your workspace. 
* Make sure that all the projects have no errors. Some of Eclipse Capra's test projects might show compilation errors due to the missing `org.eclipse.capra.generic.tracemodel` project. These can be ignored.
* Click on Run --> Run Configurations and create a new Eclipse Application Configuration
* Select a new folder as the workspace for your Eclipse application
* Click "Apply", then "Run"
* Once the new workspace opens, import the projects in this repository (apart from `org.panorama.research.waters-2019.traceMetamodel`)
* Go to Window --> Perspectives and switch to the Capra perspective
* Follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRtLs5OT_yM&feature=youtu.be) to create and visualize traceability links.

In case you get an error that the wrong APP4MC version is installed, please open `waters-challenge-2019.amxmi` in a text editor and change the model version to the APP4MC version you have installed (usually either 0.9.7 or 0.9.9, depending on the target platform chosen for Eclipse Capra).
